# Maze-Solver
###### Maze-solver tells you the which path to follow to come out of 2 dimensional matrix when some of its cells are blocked using depth first search algorithm.
###### The path is guided using directions L = left, R = right, U = up, D = down.
###### Input is given in the form of matrix of 1 and 0 only. 1 means you can go through this cell and 0 means it is blocked.
